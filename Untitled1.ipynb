    "The rating of films is based on votes on different sites. The rating includes all existing films of any genre and any director. The rating of films will easily tell you what the majority chooses.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, along with the rating are the opinions of viewers who watched the film and left their comments and opinions. In some films, TV series there are several parts and each of them has its own plot on which the story develops. Sometimes producers like to add flavor to their film, so that it is different from others and is more special and exciting like the movie \"Joker\" in which the audience saw something different and unusual, and at the same time, she pulled the viewer into what is happening in the film ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are different applications through which you can watch movies and your favorite TV shows. Every time a person rated a movie, the statistics and the rating of the movie changed, and just like in many sites and applications, data was shown on which you can see how much costs and income a particular movie brought.\n",
    "The film has many genres for which you can watch a certain type of film. But at the same time, all sites about movies have a list of recommendations for the user, which are collected in various ways to obtain data. A person may like a certain genre or the years during which films were released. Someone likes animated films and they take the received information on which they offer the user films that he may like.\n",
